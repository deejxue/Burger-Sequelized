* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the Eat Me area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the "Mmmmm" section of the page.

* Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.  New burgers are added to the database for "consumption", and can be moved to the list of eaten or not eaten by a button.
